# Hashtags

This is a simple Django project which allows you to upload multiple text files and finds the number of occurrences of each word across the files and displays which files they were found in and the sentences they occurred in.

## Setup
Nothing much. Just install django and do a git clone of this repository :)
* pip install django
* git clone https://github.com/zeemon/hashtags.git

## HashCounter
HashCounter is the main class that does the python processing of the files. Located in app/views.py. <br>
I've also written a couple of tests for the same.

## Live View
Project is uploaded at http://hashtags.zystuff.com
